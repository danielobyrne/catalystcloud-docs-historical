Migrating to the Catalyst Cloud
######################################

For this section  of the documentation we have split the content into two
parts. The first explains the different ways of migrating to a cloud
solution, alongside the benefits of why you would want to migrate away from
other forms of resource management. It also includes considerations of which
method is best for you depending on your business needs. This section is for
those who are not familiar with Cloud systems and who want to know more about
how to run their system on cloud architecture.

The second part of this documentation includes examples on how to
migrate existing resources from other cloud solutions, to your Catalyst Cloud
project. These are useful for users who have had experience working with cloud
platforms in the past and are wanting to move their current infrastructure set
up, over to the Catalyst Cloud.
